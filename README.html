    <p>For this project, we are creating personal webpages using gitbash and github. This personal webpage can help show our accomplishments, as well as what kind of     companies we would like to work for.</p>
    <p> What I did specifically for this assingment was create a new repository in github. From there, I had to go into gitbash, which is still quite difficult for me. However, this has been a great learning experience for me utilizing gitbash more. I know that by the end of this course I will have a great understanding of html and be ready for my job. For future assingments, I believe that I need to start them much earlier to give myself adequate timing. <p>
